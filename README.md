# k-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm
I was trying to replicate my own K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm using some basic library like:-<br>
<li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html">operator</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html">Counter from collections</a> </li>
Fell free to suggest any changes.<br>
Thank you.
